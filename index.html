            I have always had an interst for comptuers and what they can do as tools.  When I was younger I noticed I took interest in aspects of computers that most children my age would take for granted.  While other kids were worried about high scores I was more interested on how the game knew to only keep score when you completed the objective. As time went on I explored new hobbies and activities but computers have always been a constant passion of mine.

        <p>  After Highschool I left San Diego and atteneded University of Califorina Riverside and recieved a degree in Economics.  Once I graduted I began a career as a Finacial Advisor, I obtained my Series 7 liscnese and was about to take my Series 66 for the second time when i decied I could not be a Finacial planner any more.  I now work for an online school as a Financial cousulor. This has given me lost of insite into what school really means to me and that I know that I want technology, especially computers, to play a big role in my next career.</p>
